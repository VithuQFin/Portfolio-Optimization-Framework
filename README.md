# Portfolio Optimization Strategies

This project implements and compares several portfolio optimization methods, using historical data from multiple assets. It includes a full pipeline: from data loading and cleaning, through optimization and backtesting, all the way to performance analysis and visualizations.

---

## Features

- **Mean-Variance Optimization** (MVP & Tangency Portfolio)
- **Risk Parity Optimization**
- **Maximum Diversification Portfolio**
- **Equal-Weight Portfolio** (as benchmark)
- Performance metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Calmar Ratio, Max Drawdown, Annualized Return, etc.
- Visualizations: Efficient Frontier, Rolling Sharpe, Correlation Heatmap, Risk Contributions, etc.
- Full backtest pipeline with benchmark comparison

## How to Run

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the main pipeline:
```
python main.py
```

## Strategies Compared

Strategy	            Description
```
MVP	                    Minimum Variance Portfolio (Markowitz model)
Tangency	            Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio (with risk-free asset)
Risk Parity	            Allocates risk equally across assets
Max Diversification	    Maximizes diversification ratio (Choueifaty & Coignard, 2008)
Equal Weights	            Baseline with 1/N asset allocation
```
